      # NB. To avoid sometimes needing multiple runs, we need:
      # - trailing-whitespace BEFORE end-of-file-fixer,
      #   otherwise trailing newline followed by whitespace, "\n ",
      #   will need multiple runs.
      # - end-of-file-fixer   BEFORE mixed-line-ending,
      #   otherwise a file with CRLF line endings but missing a trailing
      #   newline will need multiple runs.
