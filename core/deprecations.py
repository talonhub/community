"""
Helpers for deprecating voice commands, actions, and captures. Since Talon can
be an important part of people's workflows providing a warning before removing
functionality is encouraged.

The normal deprecation process in knausj_talon is as follows:

1. For 6 months from deprecation a deprecated action or command should
   continue working. Put an entry in the BREAKING_CHANGES.txt file in the
   project root to mark the deprecation and potentially explain how users can
   migrate. Use the user.deprecate_command, user.deprecate_action, or
   user.deprecate_capture actions to notify users.
2. After 6 months you can delete the deprecated command, action, or capture.
   Leave the note in BREAKING_CHANGES.txt so people who missed the
   notifications can see what happened.

If for some reason you can't keep the functionality working for 6 months,
just put the information in BREAKING_CHANGES.txt so people can look there to
see what happened.

Usages:

    # myfile.talon - demonstrate voice command deprecation
    ...
    old legacy command:
        # This will show a notification to say use 'new command' instead of
        # 'old legacy command'. No removal of functionality is allowed.
        user.deprecate_command("2022-11-10", "old legacy command", "new command")
        # perform command

    new command:
        # perform command
