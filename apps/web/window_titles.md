These talon files mostly match based on the url of the target site, however by
default talon cannot find these URLs. To get the URL listed in the tab name,
and thus the win.title, you need to use a plug in:
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/domain-in-title/
Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-in-title/ignpacbgnbnkaiooknalneoeladjnfgb?hl=en

Alternatively if you are comfortable with using a name that's possibly more
prone to false positives, you can optionally use the commented out name-based
match that is present in many of the files.
