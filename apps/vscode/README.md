# VSCode support

It is recommended to install the [VSCode talon extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.talon), which will enable a couple advanced commands and improve the speed / robustness of VSCode commands.

## Cursorless

If you'd like to use Cursorless, follow the instructions in the [cursorless-talon repo](https://github.com/pokey/cursorless-talon).
