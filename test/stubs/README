This directory contains stubs of Talon APIs for use in tests. It is made available by pytest's pythonpath configuration, see pyproject.toml.

The implementation of the stubs will mostly be noops, but some functionality (e.g. actions) are needed by tests and so are implemented to allow for easy introspection and changing.
