---
* 2025-08-30 Updated community snippet commands to add a snippet stop to the end of snippets so that the final `snip next` can be used to move the cursor after the snippet. The original snippet insertion actions (user.insert_snippet_by_name and user.insert_snippet_by_name_with_phrase) still have the old behavior. You can revert to the old behavior by changing the actions used by the snippet commands in core/snippets/snippets.talon and following the commented instructions in that file. 
* 2025-08-23 Rename `user.code_common_member_function` to `user.code_common_method` now that support is getting added to other languages.
* 2025-08-09 Rename `user.code_keyword_bare` to `user.code_keyword_unprefixed` to improve clarity.
* 2025-07-10 Make `state do` for ruby insert a do while loop instead of the `do` keyword to make the behavior consistent with other languages.
* 2025-06-28 Remove user.code_block_c_like tag in favor of using `codeBlock.snippet` to handle code blocks.
* 2025-06-24 Deprecate imperative.py code state actions in favor of their corresponding snippets.
* 2025-05-26 Change the `genericForLoopStatement` snippet's name to `forLoopStatement` and change the existing `forLoopStatement` snippet's name to `forRangeStatement`. `forRangeStatement` is now used with `snip for range`.
* 2025-04-20 Deprecated php commands `(op | is) loosely equal` and `(op | is) loosely not equal` in favor of `is weak equal` and `is weak not equal`. The names of the comparison operators can be updated in lang/tags/operators_math_comparison.talon-list if desired.
* 2025-03-04 Deprecated javascript commands `(op | is) strict equal` and `(op | is) strict not equal` in favor of `is equal` and `is not equal`. Weak comparison can be done with `is weak equal` and `is weak not equal`.
* 2025-02-01 Removed snippet language inheritance. From now on typescript will not automatically use javascript snippets. Each snippet need to define every language it should be active in.
* 2025-01-19 Deprecated a bunch of programming language operator commands in favor of using Talon lists
* 2024-12-03 Introduced an intermediate layer for naming snap window positions instead of using the raw spoken forms. Instead of calling snap_window_to_position("top right") you should now call snap_window_to_position("TOP_RIGHT")
* 2024-12-26 Deprecated action `user.zoom_close` in favor of `tracking.zoom_cancel`.
* 2024-11-24 Deprecated a bunch of symbol commands to insert delimited pairs
  ("", '', []) in favor of the new `delimiter_pair` Talon list file.
* 2024-09-07 Removed `get_list_from_csv` from `user_settings.py`. Please
  use the new `track_csv_list` decorator, which leverages Talon's
  `talon.watch` API for robustness on Talon launch.
* 2024-09-07 If you've updated `community` since 2024-08-31, you may
  need to replace `host:` with `hostname:` in the header of
  `core/system_paths-<hostname>.talon-list` due to an issue with
  automatic conversion from CSV (#1268).
* 2024-07-31 Remove commands `"command mode"`, `"dictation mode"` from
  custom user modes. Note that if you have any custom modes where you
  want these commands you could add that mode to the context of
  `command_and_dictation_mode.talon` or copying the command to one of
  your custom files.
* 2024-07-30 Deprecate `lend` and `bend` commands in favor of `go line
  end | tail` and `go line start | head`.
* 2024-07-28 Removed the following user namespace actions in favor of
  the new action/modifier grammar.

    cut_word, copy_word, paste_word
    cut_all, copy_all, paste_all, delete_all
    copy_line, paste_line
    cut_line_start, copy_line_start, paste_line_start, delete_line_start
    cut_line_end, copy_line_end, paste_line_end, delete_line_end
* 2024-05-30 Deprecate 'drop down <user.number_small>' in favor of
  overridable 'choose' helper
* 2024-01-27 Deprecate '<user.number_string>' command without a spoken
  prefix like `numb`. See `numbers.talon` and
  `numbers_unprefixed.talon.` If in the future you want to still use
  unprefixed numbers, you will need to comment out the
  `tag(): user.prefixed_numbers` line in your `settings.talon` file.
* 2023-06-06 Deprecate `go` command for VSCode. Use 'bar marks' instead.
* 2023-02-04 Deprecate `murder` command for i3wm. Use 'win kill' instead.
* 2022-12-11 Deprecate user.insert_with_history. Just use
  `user.add_phrase_to_history(text); insert(text)` instead. See #939.
* 2022-10-01 Large refactoring of code base that moves many files into
  new locations. No other backwards-incompatible changes included.
