    https://github.com/talonhub/community/blob/37a8ebde90c8120a0b52555030988d4f54e65159/core/edit/edit.talon#L3
    cut_word, copy_word, paste_word
    cut_all, copy_all, paste_all, delete_all
    copy_line, paste_line
    cut_line_start, copy_line_start, paste_line_start, delete_line_start
    cut_line_end, copy_line_end, paste_line_end, delete_line_end
* 2024-05-30 Deprecate 'drop down <user.number_small>' in favor of overridable 'choose' helper
* 2024-01-27 Deprecate '<user.number_string>' command without a spoken prefix like `numb`.
See `numbers.talon` and `numbers_unprefixed.talon.` If in the future you want to still use
unprefixed numbers, you will need to comment out the
`tag(): user.prefixed_numbers` line in your `settings.talon` file.
* 2023-06-06 Deprecate `go ` command for VSCode. Use 'bar marks' instead.
* 2023-02-04 Deprecate `murder` command for i3wm. Use 'win kill' instead.
* 2022-12-11 Deprecate user.insert_with_history. Just use `user.add_phrase_to_history(text);
insert(text)` instead. See #939.
* 2022-10-01 Large refactoring of code base that moves many files into new locations. No
other backwards-incompatible changes included.
