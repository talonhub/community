* 2024-07-31 Remove commands `"command mode"`, `"dictation mode"` from custom user modes. Note that if you have any custom modes where you want these commands you could add that mode to the context of `command_and_dictation_mode.talon` or copying the command to one of your custom files.
* 2024-07-30 Deprecate `lend` and `bend` commands in favor of `go line end | tail` and `go line start | head`.
* 2024-07-28 Removed the following user namespace actions in favor of the new action/modifier grammar.

    cut_word, copy_word, paste_word
    cut_all, copy_all, paste_all, delete_all
    copy_line, paste_line
    cut_line_start, copy_line_start, paste_line_start, delete_line_start
    cut_line_end, copy_line_end, paste_line_end, delete_line_end
* 2024-05-30 Deprecate 'drop down <user.number_small>' in favor of overridable 'choose' helper
* 2024-01-27 Deprecate '<user.number_string>' command without a spoken prefix like `numb`.
See `numbers.talon` and `numbers_unprefixed.talon.` If in the future you want to still use
unprefixed numbers, you will need to comment out the
`tag(): user.prefixed_numbers` line in your `settings.talon` file.
* 2023-06-06 Deprecate `go ` command for VSCode. Use 'bar marks' instead.
* 2023-02-04 Deprecate `murder` command for i3wm. Use 'win kill' instead.
* 2022-12-11 Deprecate user.insert_with_history. Just use `user.add_phrase_to_history(text);
insert(text)` instead. See #939.
* 2022-10-01 Large refactoring of code base that moves many files into new locations. No
other backwards-incompatible changes included.
