This directory contains stubs of Talon APIs for use in tests. It is made available by a custom module loader. See conftest.py in the repo root.

The implementation of the stubs will mostly be noops, but some functionality (e.g. actions) are needed by tests and so are implemented to allow for easy introspection and changing.
